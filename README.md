## Vision

Making host-atendee interaction simple. Users post relevant questions and the audience can vote and reply. Conference host may answer the most popular ones.

## User stories

- As a conference atendee, I want to be able to easily ask questions to the host, so that I get to understand the subject better and faster.

- As a conference host, I want my audience to be able to assist each other on questions they might have, so that I'll have more time to explain other harder questions.

- As a user, I want to be able to upvote questions I find relevant, and downvote questions I find off-topic, so that the time is used to answer questions that people find the most important.

- As a user, I want to be notified when my questions are answered or verified by the host, so that I don't have to keep the app open until something happens.

- As an attendee, I want to be automatically entered into the forum corresponding to the conference I'm currently attending, so that I don't need to waste time joining a room every time I open the app.
